# Limen Tenebrae: An Interactive Black Hole Simulator

**Limen Tenebrae** is a real-time, interactive 3D simulation of a solar system, its destruction, and the birth of a black hole. Built with Python and OpenGL, this project visualizes complex astrophysical concepts, including gravitational physics, stellar evolution, and the dramatic effects of a singularity. Users can explore a dynamic solar system, trigger cataclysmic events like supernovae, and pilot a spaceship through the cosmos to witness the spectacle from any angle.

## âœ¨ Key Features

This simulation is packed with features designed to create an engaging and educational experience:

* **Complete Solar System:** A fully rendered solar system with the Sun and all eight planets, each with accurate orbital mechanics based on Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation.
* **Stunning Black Hole Visuals:** Witness a visually captivating black hole, complete with a rotating accretion disk featuring Doppler beaming, a bright photon ring, and gravitational lensing effects.
* **Dynamic Event Sequences:**
    * **Red Giant Phase:** Trigger the Sun's expansion into a red giant, engulfing the inner planets.
    * **Supernova Explosion:** Watch the Sun collapse and explode in a brilliant supernova, scattering particles across space.
    * **Planetary Capture & Debris:** Planets caught in the black hole's gravity are "spaghettified," torn apart, and absorbed, creating a persistent debris cloud that inherits the planet's color.
* **Interactive Spaceship Piloting:** Spawn and fly a Star Destroyer-class spaceship in first-person or third-person view. Navigate the solar system, dodge celestial bodies, and get a front-row seat to the cosmic action.
* **Advanced Physics Engine:** Utilizes a Velocity Verlet integration method for stable and accurate physics. The simulation also features an elastic collision model for planet-to-planet interactions.
* **Interactive UI & Controls:** An in-simulation Heads-Up Display (HUD) provides real-time data on celestial bodies, while a full suite of keyboard controls allows for camera manipulation, event triggers, and spaceship movement.
